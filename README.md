# ArrayListEditor
You are required to code an list editor for this project. The editor allows an interactive user to perform operations on a variable-length list. The list editor uses a command line interface, scanning commands entered by a user and responding to the commands until the user exits the system. The editor implements the list as a Java ArrayList. For sake of simplicity, your array list will store only integer numbers. However, one particular requirement is that the list editor use different algorithms for sorting the list, depending on the list size, in order to minimize of the execution time of the sorting. You are specifically asked to implement the following three algorithms: selection sort, quick sort and insertion sort. Furthermore, you are asked to identify a pattern from the Gang-of-four system that supports dynamically switching between the different sorting algorithms, depending on the size of the list being sorted. Your code must implement faithfully the design pattern that you identified.
